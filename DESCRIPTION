Title: Tidy Tools for Academics
Description: Tidy tools designed for use in academic research. Use functions 
  to wrangle (e.g., wide-to-long or long-to-wide) and statistically analyze 
  (e.g., Cronbach's alpha) data using conventions/techniques commonly 
  observed in academic research. This package uses tidy evaluation (a form 
  of non-standard evaluation) for ease of use and helps researchers keep their
  data and analysis tidy.
