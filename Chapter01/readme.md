In this chapter, we will describe how the various maps in this book are built, what they intend to demonstrate, and how to make sense of them. After that, we will focus on what an architect role is about, and explain the various cloud service models that are made available by the Microsoft Azure platform. 
More specifically, in this chapter we will cover the following topics:

•	About the Azure Architecture Maps

•	Mapping the Azure cloud architectures

•	The essential cloud vocabulary 

•	The key factors of a successful cloud journey

Our purpose is to help you learn the required vocabulary that is used across the book. You will also understand the duties of an Azure architect. We will explain the most frequently used service models and their typical associated use cases, which every Azure architect should know. We start smoothly, but beware that the level of complexity will increase as we go.
