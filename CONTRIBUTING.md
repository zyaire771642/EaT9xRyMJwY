### Contributing

We welcome suggestions to this reading list.

In the [issues](https://github.com/mmcgrana/services-engineering/issues)
for this repository we track specific suggestions for additions and
topics that we'd like to cover but don't have good resources for yet.

Please make your own suggestions by opening an issue or commenting
on an existing one. Please prefer issues to pull requests and one
issue for each suggested resource.

Note that the list only includes material that's been read
personally by the editor, so some suggestions may have a long
turnaround time, especially books and conferences.
